# Machine-learning-project
The course project's html, md and Rmd files are uploaded here.Please read the file "Project.html" for the html.

In addition, if you want the results of running the R code to be shown as well, see file "Project_with_all_results_printed.html". The only difference between the 2 html files is that in the latter, the results have been printed while knitting.

Html files may be viewed properly only if downloaded.

If any problems with github, the files can also be viewed at:

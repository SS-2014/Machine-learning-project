# Machine-learning-project
The course project's html, md and Rmd files are uploaded here.

Please read the file "Project.html" for the html.
However, if you want the results of the code to be shown as well, see file "Project- with all results printed.html"

The only difference between the files is that in the latter, the results have been printed while knitting.
